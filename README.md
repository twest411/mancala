p5-mancala

Mancala is an awesome game about moving pieces in a circle and hoping they stop in the right place for
you to win. Sometimes things get stolen, but they don't stay stolen. Just trust me, it's fun.

Awesome: extremely impressive or daunting; inspiring great admiration, apprehension, or fear.
